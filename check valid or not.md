Check if given Sudoku board configuration is valid or not

Given a Sudoku Board configuration, check whether it is valid or not.

The basic idea is to check whether each row, column, and the 3×3 box is valid or not on the basis of following points:
The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character ‘.’.
An empty Sudoku board is also valid.
A valid Sudoku board (partially filled) is not necessarily solvable. Only the filled cells need to be validated.
